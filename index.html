  <section class="submissions-about">
    <p class="submissions-paragraph">
      The Flood is an online publication that sits at the confluence of
      radical politics and rooted spirituality.
    </p>
    <p class="submissions-paragraph">
      Founded by a collective of young writers who met at the New York
      Catholic Worker, The Flood began as a conversation amid the daily tasks
      of running the NYCW houses of hospitality—serving soup, distributing
      clothing, and caring for the sick and elderly.
    </p>
    <p class="submissions-paragraph thesis-para">
        Histories of spirituality and social movements are inseparable.
        Experiences of the sublime bump up against the mechanisms of the state,
        bureaucracy meets intimacy, and the mundane is disrupted by jubilation.
        The Flood explores this ongoing relationship and asks:
      <span class="thesis-question">
        as the waters rise, how can we help each other stay afloat?
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="disclaimer-info">
      The Flood does not reflect the views of the NYCW or the CW newspaper,
      nor do we write from a specifically or uniquely Catholic point of view.
      Our influences and inspirations span a wide spectrum of spiritual and
      political traditions, including ecofeminism, anarchism, left Irish
      Republicanism, communal egalitarianism, Jewish and Islamic mysticism,
      Dharmic religions, animism, and a variety of Indigenous community
      structures and faiths.
